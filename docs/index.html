    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <p>
        We will implement a 4th order differential equation solver for Fluid Dynamics Simulation.
        We hope to provide interactive demos of our fluid dynamics simulator that users can play with in three.js
        Our stretch goal is to learn a PDE solver using sinusoidal activation functions.
    </p>

    <h1>
        Problem Description
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Navier-Stokes equation for fluid dynamics is one of the millennium math prize puzzles that governs many natural phenomena like water and smoke.
        We aim to write a numerical solver for this differential equation and build a web tool to visualize dynamics.
        We hope to build on top of existing solvers and codebases presented by the NVIDIA GPU Gems so that we don’t reinvent the wheel.
        The challenge lies in faithfully implementing a 4th order differential equation solver and improving the accuracy of such simulation.
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
    <h3>Part 1: Baseline Plan</h3>
    <p>
        We will implement the Navier-Stokes equation for fluid dynamics to simulate incomprehensible flow. The hope is that higher order methods will produce cleaner visual effects that model the dynamics of our chosen natural phenomena with higher fidelity. We will compare the differences between less accurate models to show that this method produces a more accurate and quicker simulation of incomprehensible flow. We hope to add different visual effects to display the exciting effects of incomprehensible flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will provide comparisons showing the difference in converge thresholds for different differential equation solvers. We will also compare visual improvements as a result of the optimization.
        We also hope to simulate the results of this project interactively, such that the user can play around with different parameters and visual effects.
    </p>


    <h3>Part 2: Inspirational Plan</h3>
    <p>
        The main goal of our project is to utilize the Navier-Stokes equation for fluid dynamics to create a simulation for fluids. Our stretch goal, however, is to use sinusoidal activation functions and neural networks to achieve an even more accurate representation of incomprehensible flow. Although this stretch goal would require us to delve deeper into neural networks and potentially utilizing a partial differential equation solver, this would result in a more accurate representation of the fluid dynamics and minimize errors.
