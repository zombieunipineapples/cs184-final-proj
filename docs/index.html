        Improving Fluid Dynamics Simulation

            We will implement a 4th order differential equation solver for Fluid Dynamics Simulation.
            We hope to provide interactive demos of our fluid dynamics simulator that users can play with in three.js
            Our stretch goal is to learn a PDE solver using sinusoidal activation functions.
        </p>


        <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
        <p align="justify">
            The Navier-Stokes equation for fluid dynamics is one of the millennium math prize puzzles that governs many natural phenomena like water and smoke.
            We aim to write a numerical solver for this differential equation and build a web tool to visualize dynamics.
            We hope to build on top of existing solvers and codebases presented by the NVIDIA GPU Gems so that we don’t reinvent the wheel.
            The challenge lies in faithfully implementing a 4th order differential equation solver and improving the fidelity of such simulation.
        </p>
        <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <p align="justify">
            We will create a visual demo that will allow a user to switch between different hyperparameters to solve the Navier-Stokes Differential Equation. The hope is that higher order methods will produce cleaner visual effects that model the dynamics of our chosen natural phenomena with higher fidelity.
            We will provide comparisons showing the difference in converge thresholds for different differential equation solvers. We will also compare visual improvements as of a result of the optimization.
